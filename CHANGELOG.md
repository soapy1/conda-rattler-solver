# Changelog

[//]: # (current developments)

## 0.1.1 (2026-06-11)

### Enhancements

* Bump `py-rattler` to `>=0.25.0,<0.26.0a0` to restore `ppc64le` support for the conda-forge build of conda. (#69)

### Bug fixes

* Raise the conda-build-specific exception when solver problems are inferred, so conda-build receives the expected error type instead of a generic conflict. (#65)
